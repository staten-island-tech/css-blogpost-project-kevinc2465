<h1>Dogs:</h1>
<h2 class="main-header">Origin</h2>
<p class="main-paragraph">Domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Reseachers haved argued that dogs actually originated from East Asia, Mongolia,  Siberia, Europe, and Africa. In addition, researchers have also said that dog's are a mess, the reason why they say that is because there was a period of time called "the giant whirlwind blender of the European crazy Victorian dog-breeding frenzy." During the period, it was said that dogs were randomly breeding by themselves and interbreeding with wolves at different time over at least the last 15,000 years. </p>
<h2>Things about them</h2>
<p>The average life of a dog ranges from 10 years to 13 years. In addition, their sense of smell is 1,000 to 10,000 times stronger than humans, which makes them great for safeguarding your house. In addition, these amazing animals could also help farmers hunt, control rodents, and even rescue people. Besides being a pet, dogs are also being treated as a type of food in Asia, and is estimated that around 13-16 million dogs are killed and consumed every year.</p>
