<h1>Dogs</h1>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>Domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Reseachers haved argued that dogs actually originated from East Asia, Mongolia,  Siberia, Europe, and Africa. In addition, researchers have also said that dog's are a mess, the reason why they say that is because there was a period of time called "the giant whirlwind blender of the European crazy Victorian dog-breeding frenzy." During the period, it was said that dogs were randomly breeding by themselves and interbreeding with wolves at different time over at least the last 15,000 years. </p>
